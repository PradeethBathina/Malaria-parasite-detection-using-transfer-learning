# Malaria-parasite-detection-using-transfer-learning

The goal of the project is to learn more about the motivation and importance of malaria, as well as the effectiveness of deep learning in detecting malaria. We want to highlight how AI can help with malaria detection and diagnosis using open-source, low-cost, effective, and accurate solutions. We can construct robust, scalable, and effective deep learning solutions using Python and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow.
The fundamental benefit of these solutions is that they are open-source and free, allowing us to create solutions that are both cost-effective and easy to adopt and use by everyone. We analyzed data from 25000 malaria-affected samples and used it for training and testing and we have built the model to predict the diseased sample with the help of Python and Tensor flow.

We collected the Malaria Cell Images dataset from Kaggle which was directly obtained from official NIH website. The dataset contains two folders (infected, uninfected) comprising total of 27558 images.
